# Prudential-Life-Insurance-Assessment
 
1. The process of life insurance purchase is complicated and involves risk analysis at multiple levels and various medical exams. Prudential wants to make the process quicker, less labor intensive and automated. By using predictive modeling, we are classifying the risk profiles of the customer based on their information.

2. Goal: 

        Build a classification model to classify the risk profiles of the customers based on their information.

3. Steps: 

         Analyzed the input and target variables and handled missing data
         
         Balanced the imbalanced data and split the dataset into training and testing sets
         
         Performed exploratory data analysis to select the best features
         
         Trained and evaluated the following machine learning models:
         
            KNN
         
            Na√Øve Bayes
        
            Decision Trees-C5.0
        
            Decision Trees-CART
        
            Random Forest

4. Based on **accuracy** as evaluation metric, Random Forest performs well. 

   Based on **ROC/AUC** as evaluation metrics, ANN performs best.

5. Based on the evaluation metrics, it was found that the Random Forest and ANN models performed the best for this classification problem.

6. CONCLUSION:

         By using predictive modeling, Prudential can classify the risk profiles of the customers based on their information and 
         automate the life insurance purchase process. The Random Forest and ANN models can be used to achieve this goal.
